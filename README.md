## Getting Started

Select which branch you want to use. There are two branches available at the moment:

Clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Branches

I plan on creating multiple branches with different features and configurations. If you have any suggestions, please let me know.

### Main

This is the main branch. It contains the most basic configuration and features.This includes a basic layout, a few pages, and a few components.

### Personal Site

This branch is for those who want to use this as a personal site. It serves as a site to showcase your work experience, skills, and get in touch with you.

#### Email Form

This branch is setup with [emailJS](https://www.emailjs.com/) to send emails from your site. It also includes a contact form and a few pages. In order to use use emailJS, you will need to create an account and add your credentials to the `.env` file. See the [emailJS docs](https://www.emailjs.com/docs/) for more information on how to do this.

Here is an example of the emailJS template I used. You can use this as a starting point for your own template, but make sure you update the `templateParams` to match your own template.

### Developer Portfolio - Coming Soon

This branch is for those who want to use this as a developer portfolio. It serves as a site to showcase your projects, skills, and get in touch with you.


## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.

## Nitty Gritty

### Icons

This project uses [React Icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/) for icons, specifically the [Remix Design Icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/icons?name=ri). If you need the svg files, you can find them [here](https://github.com/Remix-Design/RemixIcon/tree/master/icons).

### Favicons and Head Tags

Use [Favicon.io](https://favicon.io/favicon-converter/) to generate your favicon and add the generated code to the `pages/_document.js` file. Make sure you download the generated files and add them to the `public` folder. You will need to create an image for [Favicon.io](https://favicon.io/favicon-converter/) to use. I recommend using [Canva](https://www.canva.com/) to create your image.

### Customizing Colors and Dark/Light Mode

This project uses [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling. You can customize the colors and dark/light mode by editing the `tailwind.config.js` file. See the [Tailwind CSS docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/customizing-colors) for more information on how to do this.

In short, you find something that looks like this in the `tailwind.config.js` file:

```js
  //...
    extend: {
      colors: {
        primaryText: colors.zinc,
        accent: colors.sky,
        gradientStart: colors.sky,
        gradientEnd: colors.stone,
      },
    },
  //...
```

The `colors` object is where you can add your own colors. You can use the [Tailwind CSS color palette reference](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/customizing-colors#color-palette-reference) to find the colors you want to use.

For example, if you wanted to change the `primaryText` color to `blue`, you would change it to this:

```js
  //...
    extend: {
      colors: {
        primaryText: colors.blue, // <-- Change color name here
        accent: colors.sky,
        gradientStart: colors.sky,
        gradientEnd: colors.stone,
      },
    },
  //...
```
